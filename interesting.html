                    <h2>Friendly fire has right of way</h2>
                    <p>
                        There's this old story from the Allied forces fighting in post D-day invasion of Normandy. It goes something along
                        the lines of this...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A British platoon captures a German platoon, and as they're marching towards the beach to process the prisoners, a
                        German <abbr title="Prisoner Of War">POW</abbr> spots a British plane in the sky, and all the Germans duck and cover.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometime later, a British soldier spots a German airplane in the sky, and all the Tommies search for cover.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As they're nearing the prisoner processing facility, someone spots an American plane, and everyone looks for cover.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you encounter a unit you can't identify, you fire one round over their heads so it can't hit anyone...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the response is a fusillade of rapid, precisely aimed rifle fire, they're British.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the response is a hailstorm of machine gun fire, they're Germans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If they drop their weapons and surrender, they're Italians.

                        If absolutely nothing happens and you soon find yourself under intense scrutiny of heavy air and artillery
                        bombardment, they're American.

                        When you see planes in the sky attacking our (German) forces, its the Royal Air Force.

                        If you see the planes attacking the enemy forces (The Allied Nations) then its the US Army Air Force.

                    <h2>Icy cold treats</h2>
                    <p>
                        How far would you go for a treat of ice cream? Here we tell two stories from the US Navy, which had caught up with
                        having ice cream as a treat for service members during World War 2.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A pair of officers were trying to pull rank to cut the queue for the ice crea, when they suddenly get yelled at from
                        behind to stand in line like everyone else.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon turning around, they see to their great dismay Admiral Halsey patiently waiting in line with the rest of the
                        sailors.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        But just cutting in line can't be everything, right? How about going for the ice cream stores when your aircraft
                        carrier is sinking after being bombed by the Japanese?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        USS Lexington <abbr title="Cruiser Voler, Aircraft Carrier Hull">CV-2</abbr> ship electrician Merle Lebbs recalls that a warrant officer started distributing ice cream as
                        the order to abandon ship is given.
