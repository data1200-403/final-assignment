                <p>
                    There's this old story from the Allied forces fighting in post D-day invasion of Normandy. It goes something along the lines of this...
                </p>
                <p>
                    A British platoon captures a German platoon, and as they're marching towards the beach to process the prisoners, a German POW spots a British plane in the sky, and all the Germans duck and cover
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometime later, a British soldier spots a German airplane in the sky, and all the Tommies search for cover.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As they're nearing the prisoner processing facility, someone spots an American plane, and everyone looks for cover
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you encounter a unit you can't identify, you fire one round over their heads so it can't hit anyone...
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the response is a fusillade of rapid, precisely aimed rifle fire, they're British
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the response is a hailstorm of machine gun fire, they're Germans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If they drop their weapons and surrender to the winning side, they're Italians.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If absolutely nothing happens and you soon find yourself under intense scrutiny of heavy air and artillery bombardment, they're American.

                <p>
                    Theres also a similar anecdote told from the German's perspective mocking American fighter jockey mentality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you see planes in the sky attacking our (German) forces, its the Royal Air Force.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you see the planes attacking the enemy forces (The Allied Nations) then its the US Army Air Force.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you see no planes in the sky, its the Luftwaffe!

                <h2>Icy cold treats</h2>
                <p>
                    How far would you go for a treat of ice cream? Here we tell two stories from the US Navy, which had caught up with having ice cream as a treat for service members during World War 2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A pair of officers were trying to pull rank to cut the queue for the ice crea, when they suddenly get yelled at from behind to stand in line like everyone else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon turning around, they see to their great dismay Admiral Halsey patiently waiting in line with the rest of the sailors.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But just cutting in line can't be everything, right? How about going for the ice cream stores when your aircraft carrier is sinking after being bombed by the Japanese?
                </p>
                <p>
                    USS Lexington (CV-2) ship electrician Merle Lebbs recalls that a warrant officer started distributing ice cream as the order to abandon ship is given.
