                        Having read both the tasks and announcements regarding the content of the page itself, we concluded that we would
                        rather write about some interesting World War 2 stories as filler text instead of using lorem ipsum or other filler
                        text.

                    <p>
                        Lorem Ipsum is difficult to read and use as filler text as its hard to visualise and understand the context of
                        filler text itself, and to find reasonable headings and other semantic tags to use.

                        The group really struggled to find inspiration to write about our experience as first year students at OsloMet, and
                        we preferred to write about something else that had no relevance to university life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The choice of World War 2 comes from an interest in preserving history itself, and we chose to take some interesting
                        stories, anecdotes and perhaps myths, present them in an interesting way and finally take a look at the reality
                        behind these stories.

                        With the content behind cohesive to a topic, its easier to show our understanding of correct semantic tags use, and

                        interesting this way.

                        War is a brutal endevour best sought to be avoided, however behind the brutality there often is humanity. The
                        stories we selected are not directly combat stories, rather anecdotes of some of the common myths, and interesting
                        stories.

                        We do not take any political stake in the events, and any errors in reproduction of these stories are ours and not
