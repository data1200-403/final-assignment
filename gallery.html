                <h2>Rise of Naval Air Power</h2>
                <div class="gallery-text">
                    <div class="gallery-text-content">
                        <h3>Flattops</h3>
                        <p>
                            With World War One demonstrating the potential that air power has, with pilots going from throwing rocks (and
                            insults) to timed machine guns firing through the spinning propellors, it was only natural for aircraft to
                            eventually find their way onto ships as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The race to build the first aicraft carriers had begun, and the major naval powers began experimenting with how to
                            allow planes to take off and land at sea.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Well, planes need a takeoff and landing strip to take off, and early biplanes (and even tri-planes!) had very low
                            stall speeds, being able to, in the right conditions, to almost hover in place if winds were strong enough.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So naturally, flight decks were considered for ships, however what <em>kind</em> of ship was a major question.
                            During the infancy of the <abbr title="Cruiser Voler">CV</abbr> it was the Cruiser hull that set the basis for 
                            the US Navy hull designation, and the standard that would be seen in use through the English speaking world.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Firepower</h3>
                        <p>
                            Cruisers were generally known to be jack of all trades when it comes to warships, being fast enough, well enough
                            armoured with good enough firepower.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In our first gallery you can see some of the earliest aircraft carriers ever built and tested. While nobody really
                            knew what the future of naval aviation would be, two main designs appeared:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The "battlecarriers" such as Lexington and Kaga, built off battlecruiser hulls and armed with 8in (203mm) and 20cm
                            guns respectively, these large ships were thought to be able to defend themselves against hostile cruisers while
                            launching aircraft.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The "light" aircraft carriers such as Langley and Houshou were built off lighter ships (Langley was converted from a
                            collier, Houshou was a purpose designed and built aircraft carrier). The lighter and smaller designs were built
                            purely as aircraft carriers, to be held well away from surface combat.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In the gallery below, you can see some examples of both battlecarriers and light carriers.

                <h2>Death of the Battleships</h2>
                <div class="gallery-text">
                    <div class="gallery-text-content">
                        <h3>Better engines, bigger payload</h3>
                        <p>
                            As engine and airframe technology improved, so did their ability to bring heavier bomb and torpedo loads. As the gun
                            armed ships ruled the seas up to World War One, and missiles rule the skies now, aircraft truly changed the way
                            battles were fought ever since.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many notable ships were sunk, and battles fought using naval aviation, from the US being dragged into the war with
                            the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbour, to the destruction of Yamato, the largest battleship class ever built.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Similar to the early CVs, once it was made clear flattops were not designed for frontline combat (as an example,
                            Lexington could not fire her 8in armaments over the deck as the blast would damage the flight deck itself) the
                            designs again continued along two distinct paths.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="gallery-text-content">
                        <h3>Two notable developments</h3>
                        <p>
                            The "fleet carrier" (USN hull designation CV) were the larger of the types, with many able to carry and launch over
                            60 planes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The other type were the "light" and "escort" carriers (USN hull designation CVL and CVE respectively). These were
                            lighter, smaller carriers with much smaller capacity, however were cheaper and faster to build.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The major upside to to more, but smaller flattops was that each loss of a ship meant fewer planes lost, and each
                            additional flight deck meant faster "cycling" of aircraft, as each flight deck can only take off or land one plane
                            at the same time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A fleet of 5 CVLs with 20 planes each can launch its wave of 100 aircraft faster, which means less waiting around
                            for the first planes to take off and thus less need for fuel. More flight decks also means one can be used to cycle
                            combat air patrols that protect and scout for the fleet.
                        </p>
