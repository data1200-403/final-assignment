            <h2>Zuikaku</h2>
            <p>0610 Having reached a position some 300 miles southwest of Tulagi, and received sighting reports at 0522 and 0545 of enemy ships - including a carrier and cruiser -- well south of his position just where he expected them, Hara launches a full strike from his CarDiv 5 of 18 fighters, 36 dive-bombers and 24 torpedo planes under commmand of LtCdr. Takahashi Kikuichi (ZUIKAKU's share is 9 fighters, 18 dive-bombers, and 12 torpedo planes). Yet the strike is barely away when starting at 0620 and onwards the cruiser search planes begin sighting reports of forces south of Rossel Island and southwest of MO Striking Force, including enemy carriers. But these don't start reaching CarDiv 5 until about 0700 and Hara is not in a position to act on it yet. For logistical reasons it is undesirable to try to divert a mass strike in flight, and the original target is just as promsing as the new ones.</p>

            0915 Having reached the location of the supposed enemy task force and searched for two hours, but seeing only an oiler and destroyer reported earlier, LtCdr Takahashi gradually realize this is the "carrier and cruiser" reported Earlier. Resigned, Takahashi decides to attack it with his dive-bombers and sends the torpedo planes back to the carriers. At 0926 the Japanese dive bombers attack, sinking destoyer SIMs with three direct hits and gravely wounding the oiler, NEOSHO, with seven more, leaving her dead in the water and listing sharply to starboard.( Subsequently the embattled survivors of both NEOSHO and SIMs will endure a harrowing drift aboard a supposedly sinking vessel that nonetheless stays stubbornly afloat all the way to afternoon of May 11 when finally discovered by search flights and destroyer HENLEY reaches her. She then scuttles the gallant tanker. Others who abandoned ship too hastily on May 7 are never found, save for four picked up three days later). In the attack ZUIKAKU lost one D3A1; and another two were damaged upon landing back aboard.
