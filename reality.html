                    <h2>Not so friendly fire</h2>
                    <p>
                        Friendly fire is a real issue in combat, and stories of American aircraft harrassing allied troops are plenty.
                        During Operation Cobra, <q cite="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/friendly-fire-normandy-us-bombers-massacred-hundreds-us-army-troops-172538">enraged
                            troops of the 120th Infantry Regiment even opened fire on the American planes. </q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was in this operation that the highest ranking US officer, General McNair, was killed in the war. He was killed
                        by his own strategic bombers dropping short.
                        You can read more about the story <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/06/06/the-little-known-d-day-operation-that-accidentally-killed-more-than-100-u-s-troops/">here.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There were other notable cases of air to ground friendly fire, one including some British <abbr
                            title="Royal Air Force">RAF</abbr> Hurricanes strafed out
                        a spectator stand during a tactical air firepower demonstration at the Imber training grounds. You can read more
                        about this incident <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140411134842/http://www.communigate.co.uk/wilts/wiltshistoricalmilitarysociety/page17.phtml">here.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the case of the Imber demonstration incident, there were multiple factors leading up to the incident. A
                        combination of bad sight, insufficient breifing and missing markings for the no-fire zone led to the pilot engaging
                        the spectator stand instead of dummy targets.

                    <h2>Experience and training</h2>
                    <p>
                        While it may seem like some of our anecdotes are mocking the Americans, we do need to keep in mind some of the
                        context behind each very event. In the end, the Americans didn't have an exceedingly large amount of friendly fire
                        incidents compared to their contemporaries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What the Americans did implement for their forces was for any Private soldier to be able to call in fire support for
                        their units and the American air and firepower superiority they enjoyed during after the Normandy landings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another contributing factor could be the fighter jockey mentality. With the German Luftwaffe being all but a relic
                        of the past with few planes ready for combat, pilots eager to get to fight Germany's best would find only
                        disappointment.

                                Total number of Luftwaffe sorties flown on 6 June 1944 was only about 100 missions, nearly all by fighters or fighter
                                reconnaissance aircraft. Conversely, over three thousand Allied fighters and ground attack aircraft formed a dense
                                protective umbrella over the Normandy beachheads and extended their operational areas deep into France as the
                                beachheads were consolidated.

                    <p>
                        With a lack of aerial targets to engage, many US fighter pilots (and planes not designed for the ground attack role)
                        were pushed into the ground attack role, with the expected detriment to precision expected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There were tests conducted against a Panther tank painted white with the utmost of visibility conditions (and no
                        angry Germans shooting back). Live fire tests conducted with rockets. Hit probability against the most perfect of
                        targets from the air turned out to be around 5%.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This statistic illustrates the difficulty in just hitting a target, let along identifying its model, identifying
                        markings to know if its friend or foe. (there were many captured vehicles pressed into service, especially by the
                        German military)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now combine this with the enemy shooting back, and the pilot's interest in not pancaking their plane into the ground
                        and you can try to visualise how difficult it is to know for sure if you're attacking the enemy.

                    <p>
                        First some context behind the importance of ice cream for the US servicemembers during World War 2: With prohibition
                        banning the production and sale of alchohol in the US, ice cream had its resurgenc after the suger shortage and
                        restrictions that came as a result of the first world war.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ice cream was an important morale boost to US servicemembers during World War 2, providing a reminder of home for
                        those on long combat deployments far from the comforts of home.
                    </p>

                        In the case of cutting the line, its a widely repeated story about discipline and waiting your turn, even repeated
